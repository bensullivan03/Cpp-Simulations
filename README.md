## C++ Physics Simulations

Various simulations I've made while learning C++

Particle Collisions simulates how the coefficient of restitution affects particle motion.
Planets contains a simulation of how different starting parameters affect planetary motion. 

Both use GNUPlot to render and were submitted as part of the Computaional Physics Project in my second year of uni. They were the first physics simulations I made in C++.


String wave is the first simulation I made using openGL. The physics is simple since I was trying to get to grips with openGL.

Single and Double Pendulum simulate pendulum motion for 1 and 2 pendulums respectively. Single pendulum is working correctly, but the double pendulum simulation seems off. I think that I must have implemented the equations of motion incorrectly. When I have some free time I may look into going through the physics/ code again.

Might add damping to pendulums + waves in the future.
